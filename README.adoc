= What?

A stream processing language and compiler for human-scale infrastructure monitoring

"The right solution for 100X often not optimal for X" -- Dean Jeff

= Why?

Those last years, thanks to such large companies as Google, Facebook, Linkedin
and Netflix, the culture and practice of modern infrastructure monitoring has
vastly improved and many good and free tools have been released publicly. Those
tools understandably focus on large distributed infrastructure.

For smaller use cases though, tools have been left to where they were in the
90s, with the notable exception of http://riemann.io/[Riemann]. But Riemann is
only for monitoring hosts and uses Clojure as a configuration language. Which
in turns requires a resource hungry JVM.

If you need an all-purpose stream processor to manipulate time series in order
to turn inputs from sensors or network probes into alerts but do not want to
deploy Kubernetes in your three racks of hardware or have only a couple of GiB
left of RAM for monitoring, then you might want to consider Ramen.

= How?

This is how operations look like:

[source,sql]
----
DEFINE memory_alert AS
  FROM memory
  SELECT
    time, host,
    free + used + cached + buffered + slab AS total,
    free * 100 / total AS used_ratio,
    used_ratio > 50 AS firing
  GROUP BY host
  COMMIT AND KEEP ALL WHEN COALESCE (out.firing <> previous.firing, false)
  NOTIFY "http://192.168.1.1/notify?title=RAM%20is%20low%20on%20${host}&time=${time}&text=Memory%20on%20${host}%20is%20filled%20up%20to%20${used_ratio}%25";
----

Currently the stream processing programs are compiled by default into a
language with automatic memory management (OCaml), so performance is not
optimal (although low level data manipulations are performed in C). There is
also a way to transpile all operations down to C++ if you feel adventurous.
The default version has proven fast enough (in the order of half a million
tuples per seconds for non trivial operations on a normal server).

Also, imports/exports are limited: Ramen currently accepts time series from CSV
files or Kafka, and understands collectd and netflow (v5) protocols. As output,
it merely reach out to alerting systems via HTTP requests.

Other than that it is possible to “tail” the output of operations from the CLI.
More protocols for both input and output need obviously to be added.
