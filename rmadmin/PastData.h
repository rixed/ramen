/* This stores past values of a given function.
 * Each request to access past data will lead the server to replay the
 * data for that time range, which is an expensive operation. Also, many times
 * we are interested in a few fields out of many, but we nonetheless request
 * and cache the full tuple for the sake of simplicity.
 *
 * When a time range is requested, only the missing data is requested; boundary
 * timestamp equality will then be used to merge the result into preexisting
 * PastDataChunks as much as possible.
 *
 * Replays must be limited in size as to avoid the backend to read very large
 * amount of data. In theory, this is related to the storage configuration, and
 * if everything is configured properly then no replay should have to process
 * huge amount of data.  In reality, a process to limit the size of the
 * response is needed; ideally controlled solely from the client side. This is
 * still TODO.
