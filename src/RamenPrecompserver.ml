(* Service in charge of generating the "info" files.
 *
 * Before it is possible to start a new program, and before the choreographer
 * can create one (or several) worker(s) for this program, and before the
 * supervisor can compile the worker, then the used source file must be
 * pre-compiled (aka. parsed and type-checked) and the result of this pre-
 * compilation saved in an "info" file.
 * The precompserver is the daemon in charge of this.
 * Sometimes, the pre-compilation can succeed as soon as a new source files
 * appear. But it also frequently happen that a source program depends on some
 * external program that is not (yet) running, and therefore the pre-compilation
 * must be delayed.
 *
 * The downsides of these delays are several:
 * - that we do not know instantly if the new program fails to type check;
 * - the same source may have to be parsed several times before type-checking
 *   can be attempted.
 * For this later point it would be nice to have either an "ast" file before the
 * "info" or a partial error status with the AST in the info file (TODO).
 *
 * The upside is that we do not need to declare parents output types beforehand.
 *
 * Alternatively, we could also type-check only just before supervisor compiles
 * the worker, but it is much more robust for the types to be known beforehand.

(* Do not generate any executable file, but parse/typecheck new or updated

 * The only change required from the builder is:
 * - source/target files are read from and written to the config tree instead

 * - instead of using mtime, it must use the md5s;
 * - it must stop before reaching the .x but instead aim for a "/info".
