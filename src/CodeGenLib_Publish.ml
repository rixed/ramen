(* This module implements the part of a worker that connects to the confserver
 * and output tuples in every requested destinations.
 * When a worker wants to commit a tuple it just calls the function returned
 * by [make_outputer].
 * It is then forwarded to each taillers and configured outputs.
 *
 * The communication with the confserver itself happens in a separate thread,
 * and there is a queue of commands ([cmd_queue]) for outgoing messages to the
 * confserver.
 *
 * For tuple outputs, this module maintains a hash of outputing functions
 * indexed by recipients ([outputers]).
