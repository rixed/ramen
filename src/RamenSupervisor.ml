(* Using the conf server to supervise the workers goes in several stages:
 *
 * First, client tools such as `ramen run`, `ramen kill`, `ramen replay`
 * or rmadmin, write the whole TargetConfig value into the TargetConfig key
 * (alternatively, into the RC file and then filesyncer copy it into
 * TargetConfig).
 *
 * Then, the choregrapher react to that change, recompute the FuncGraph
 * and expose it back on the configuration, into the per site / per
 * worker configuration tree. In particular, the presence of the IsUsed
 * key (be it true or false) tells that a worker must run (Archivist and
 * others might also store per worker info for non-running workers).
 *
 * Finally, the supervisor will react to the exposed FuncGraph for the
 * site it's in charge of, and try to make the running configuration for the
 * local site comply with it. In turn, it will expose the actual state
 * into the per site / per worker configuration tree.
 *
 * The only issue is that when a process state is written, it cannot be
 * read back before a round-trip to the conf server ; an issue that will not
 * cause great harm and that should be alleviated entirely later when the
 * confclient writes in its local hash (at least optionally) the values that
 * it sets.
 *
 * A process is running if its pid is stored (as an int) in the worker
 * info. If not, and there is a binary (a string), then spawn it. If there
 * is no binary, compile the source (ref to the info, as well as its md5,
 * found in the per site config). If there is no such info, wait for the
 * choreographer to finish its job.
 *
 * When a process has a pid but must not be running, send a kill (which signal
 * depends on the last killed info also in the config tree).
 *
 * When a children terminates, also update the config tree (remove the pid,
 * write the last exit status).
 *
 * Info regarding former workers that are no longer running are kept until
 * it becomes clear when to delete them. Maybe a specific command, equivalent
 * to the `ramen kill --purge`?
