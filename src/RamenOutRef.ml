(* OutRef files are the files describing where a func should send its
 * output. It's basically a list of ringbuf files, with a bitmask of fields
 * that must be written, and an optional timestamp  after which the export
 * should stop (esp. useful for non-ring buffers).
 * Ring and Non-ring buffers are distinguished with their filename
 * extensions, which are either ".r" (ring) or ".b" (buffer).
 * This has the nice consequence that you cannot have a single file name
 * repurposed into a different kind of storage.
 *
 * In case of non-ring buffers, on completion the file is renamed with the
 * min and max sequence numbers and timestamps (if known), and a new one is
 * created.
 *
 * We want to lock those files, both internally (same process) and externally
 * (other processes), although we are fine with advisory locking.
 * Unfortunately lockf will only lock other processes out so we have to combine
 * RWLocks and lockf.
