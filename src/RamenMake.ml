(* A library to help with (re)building worker binaries.
 * As we can use several languages for specifying a worker code (ramen language
 * or the alerting API structure) we let users register builders from one file
 * type (extension) to another.
 *
 * All sources are taken from the shared configuration tree, although the
 * underlying builders use local files so that `ramen compile` can be used
 * locally with no need for the confserver daemon. *)

(*
 * Register of all known builders.
 *
 * We use file extension to determine file type: ".ramen" is for ramen language
 * (current version), ".x" is for executable, ".alert" for (current version of)
 * alerts...  Notice that at this point the file type has no version. But we
 * could also append version string to that extension, and use builders to
 * convert one version to the next. In that case we would always keep the
 * original source but as we do the conversions as lazily as possible (based on
 * file modification times, like make) this choice does not incur much latency.
 * The up side is that we are free to improve the converter from release to
 * release.
 *
 * To find a path from source to binary, as the number of registered builders
 * is expected to stay rather small, no fancy alg is required just plain brute
 * force.
