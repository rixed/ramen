(* A small program that benchmark the HeavyHitters module, either for
 * correctness or speed.
 * It receives the top parameters on the command line and then generate as
 * many entries as needed with a configurable distribution.
 * Every time a value is added the top is asked to classify the point (either
 * in the top or not). In parallel, the test tracks the values that are
 * supposed to be the actual heavy hitters and estimates the correctness of
 * the answer.
 *
 * We can thus learn about the trade off between max-top-size and resolution,
 * for different flatness of distributions. *)
