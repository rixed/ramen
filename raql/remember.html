<body><h1>Remember values for some time</h1>
<p>this is an aggregate function. As such, it accepts a single operand which can wither be a scalar, in which case it will operate in turn on each item of the group, or an array or a vector in which case it will operate on each value in sequence and return the result (in practice, this process is delayed until the group is submitted for performance reasons)</p>
<p>User can choose to skip over NULL values or to include them in the computation with one of the modifiers <em>SKIP NULLS</em>
 to skip NULL values (the default) and <em>KEEP NULLS</em>
 to include them.</p>
<p>In the first case the result will still be NULL if all input values are NULL, and in the last case any NULL value will
                 make the result NULL.</p>
<p>The other modifier tells whether the state used to compute the aggregate must be local (each group has its own independent state) or global (all groups share a single state). In general when using a GROUP-BY clause the former behavior is intended, and it is thus the default when an explicit GROUP-BY clause is present. Otherwise, the default is to use only one global state.</p>
<p>One can choose between those two with the modifier <em>LOCALLY</em>
 to force a group-wise state and <em>GLOBALLY</em>
 to force a global state.</p>
<p>This choice of the state lifespan is only meaningful when the operation is applied to a single scalar value, since the state required to compute the end result over a literal array or vector lives only as long as that computation.</p>

<p>RECALL(…float-expr…, …time-expr…, …num-expr…, …expr…)</p>
<h2>Typing</h2>
<p>FLOAT, FLOAT, num, t -&gt; BOOL</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uses a series of Bloom-filters to remember any value for a given duration.</p>
<p>Returns TRUE if the value have been already encountered up to a configurable time <em>D</em>
 in the past (3rd operand).</p>
<p>The rate of false positive is provided (as the first operand) so that the trade-off between memory consumption and accuracy is easy to configure.</p>
<p>The 4th and last operand is the value to be remembered.</p>
<p>When a new value is remembered, the <b>REMEMBER</b>
 function will refresh its memory so that this value will be remembered for the next <em>D</em>
 duration, whereas the <b>RECALL</b>
 function will not, so that values will be reminded only for a duration <em>D</em>
 after it&apos;s first encountered.</p>
