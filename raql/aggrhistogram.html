<body><h1>Build an histogram</h1>
<p>this is an aggregate function. As such, it accepts a single operand which can wither be a scalar, in which case it will operate in turn on each item of the group, or an array or a vector in which case it will operate on each value in sequence and return the result (in practice, this process is delayed until the group is submitted for performance reasons)</p>
<p>User can choose to skip over NULL values or to include them in the computation with one of the modifiers <em>SKIP NULLS</em>
 to skip NULL values (the default) and <em>KEEP NULLS</em>
 to include them.</p>
<p>In the first case the result will still be NULL if all input values are NULL, and in the last case any NULL value will
                 make the result NULL.</p>
<p>The other modifier tells whether the state used to compute the aggregate must be local (each group has its own independent state) or global (all groups share a single state). In general when using a GROUP-BY clause the former behavior is intended, and it is thus the default when an explicit GROUP-BY clause is present. Otherwise, the default is to use only one global state.</p>
<p>One can choose between those two with the modifier <em>LOCALLY</em>
 to force a group-wise state and <em>GLOBALLY</em>
 to force a global state.</p>
<p>This choice of the state lifespan is only meaningful when the operation is applied to a single scalar value, since the state required to compute the end result over a literal array or vector lives only as long as that computation.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>HISTOGRAM(…expr…, …const-float…, …const-float…, …const-int…)</p>
<h2>Typing</h2>
<p>t, FLOAT, FLOAT, N:uint -&gt; u32[N+2]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Given a sequence of numeric values, build an histogram for values between the provided minimum and maximum values.</p>
<p>The third operand is the number of buckets.</p>
<p>The operation returns a vector of this number of buclets unsigned counters, with one extra bucket at each end to account for values respectively lesser and greater than the limits.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The histogram limits and number of nuckets must be constants.</p>
