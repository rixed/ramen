<body><h1>Minimum (aggregate)</h1>
<p>this is an aggregate function. As such, it accepts a single operand which can wither be a scalar, in which case it will operate in turn on each item of the group, or an array or a vector in which case it will operate on each value in sequence and return the result (in practice, this process is delayed until the group is submitted for performance reasons)</p>
<p>User can choose to skip over NULL values or to include them in the computation with one of the modifiers <em>SKIP NULLS</em>
 to skip NULL values (the default) and <em>KEEP NULLS</em>
 to include them.</p>
<p>In the first case the result will still be NULL if all input values are NULL, and in the last case any NULL value will
                 make the result NULL.</p>
<p>The other modifier tells whether the state used to compute the aggregate must be local (each group has its own independent state) or global (all groups share a single state). In general when using a GROUP-BY clause the former behavior is intended, and it is thus the default when an explicit GROUP-BY clause is present. Otherwise, the default is to use only one global state.</p>
<p>One can choose between those two with the modifier <em>LOCALLY</em>
 to force a group-wise state and <em>GLOBALLY</em>
 to force a global state.</p>
<p>This choice of the state lifespan is only meaningful when the operation is applied to a single scalar value, since the state required to compute the end result over a literal array or vector lives only as long as that computation.</p>
